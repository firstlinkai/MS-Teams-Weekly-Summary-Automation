# MS Teams Weekly Summary Automation (n8n + OpenAI)

This project automates the creation of **weekly conversation summaries** from Microsoft Teams channels using **n8n** and **OpenAI**.  

The workflow runs every Monday morning, collects last week’s activity from a chosen Teams channel, and generates a clean summary that is posted back into Teams.  
It helps project managers and team members quickly catch up on what was discussed and decided—without scrolling through endless chat history.
